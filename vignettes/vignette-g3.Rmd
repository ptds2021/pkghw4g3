## Goals 

The goal of this package is to calculate a definite area. Then, we can plot the result.

The main functions of this package are : 

- estimate_area : This function calculate the area based on some constraints. It generates a number of points based on Uniform distribution (B parameter) 

- plot.area : This function plots the results of our simulation. It draws the constraints and displays all the points.


## Shiny App

There is also a shiny application for the user; He/she can specify the paramters (B & seed) and see the visualization of our simulation. The application also displays the running time and the estimated area.
